The Plan for this Project:
Program displays catalog of games as such:
[Title] [Played/Unplayed] [Completed/Uncompleted][Platform(s)] [Generes].

Program asks user if should make new catalog (make location of file) or use old one (asks where file is).
By default displays all aplhabetically by title after creation or loading of catalog.
Program take commands addGame, displayPlayed/Unplayed(alphabetically by title),displayByPlatform(Alphabetically by
platforms then alphabetically by title), displayByGenre(alphabetically by genre).
