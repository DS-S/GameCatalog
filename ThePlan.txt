Program take commands addGame, displayPlayed/Unplayed(alphabetically), displayByReleaseDate, diplayAll(alphabetically),
    displayByPlatform(Alphabetically for platforms then alphabetically for title) displayByGenre(alphabetically).

Steps:
Learn to make database in Python (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pd-0G0MigUA).
    Program:
        Ask user to make new database or read in old one.
        Provide list of commands for user to use e.g. display <Played/Unplayed/all> ||| order <alphabetically/date> |||
        search <title> |||
        Let user exit program and ask user if want to save changes or not if any changes made
